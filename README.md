This is just a little game I made in one of my computer science classes a while ago. I decided to integtate it into TerminL <put the link somewhere> so I had to make a github file for it because it crashes if you don't have the file.

This was not entirely created by me. The teaching program I was using provided a LOT of the code for the leaderboard. If i need to include anything else to avoid piracy, please tell me.
